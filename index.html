<p>
  The Big Mac Index is an informal way to measure purchasing power parity. </p>
 <p>
  The Big Mac Index is based on the theory of purchasing power parity,
</p> 
<p>
  ccording to which the exchange rate should equalize the cost of a
</p> 
<p>

  basket of goods in different countries but instead of a basket, one standard
</p>
<p>

  burger is taken, produced by McDonald's worldwide 
</p>
<p>

  This is done in order to determine the real exchange rates of the currencies of various countries. 
</p>
<p>

  Such studies have been carried out by The Economist since 1986. 
</p>
<p>
  The Big Mac is used by the journal's experts as a benchmark for two reasons:
</p>The Big Mac is used by the journal's experts
<p>

  McDonald's is represented in most countries of the world, and the Big Mac
</p>
 <p>

   itself contains enough food components (bread, cheese, meat and vegetables)
 </p> 
 <p>

   to be considered a universal cast of the national economy. Its value in each country
 </p>
 <p>

   depends on the volume of production, rental prices, raw materials, labor and other factors.
 </p>
 <p>

   This method allows you to see the discrepancy between the value of currencies in countries
 </p>
 <p>

   with a similar level of income, especially in a crisis, when an expensive currency is 
 </p>
 <p>

   especially unprofitable. A weak currency gives an advantage in terms of costs and product prices.
